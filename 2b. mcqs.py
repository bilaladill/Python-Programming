# ================== (example of making mcqs for sir farhan) ======================

# ============ mcq from 'difference' (set method) =============

# 1. what will be the output of

# firstSet = {88, 99, 44, 55, 66, 22, 11}
# secondSet = {77, 33, 44, 66, 22, 11}
# diff = firstSet.difference(secondSet)
# print(diff)

# a) {66, 99, 55, 88, 77}
# b) {88, 99, 55}
# c) {33, 77}
# d) {99, 55, 88}
